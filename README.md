# Code in the Dark Challenge Rules - KotlinConf 2024
## Objective:
Participants must accurately replicate a provided UI design across multiple platforms using Compose Multiplatform and Fleet, without the ability to preview their work until the challenge is complete.

## Team size
You are allowed to partake on your own or in a team of 2.

## Tools & Frameworks:
- [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)
- [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/fleet.html)
## Duration:
- **Total time:** 10 minutes per session. But only a single machine per team.
## Rules:
### 1. No Previews Allowed:
Participants cannot preview their output during the coding session.
### 2. Single Environment:
All coding must be done within the Fleet. No external tools or references are allowed.
### 3. Execution Window:
After 5 minutes into the session, participants are allowed to run their application once.
### 4. No Measurement Tools:
Participants cannot use any tools to measure elements like color or sizes.
### 5. Coding in the Dark:
Participants will not see the live preview of their code; however, the audience will via separate monitors.
## Voting and Judging:
- At the end of the session, participants will present their applications on Android, iOS, and Desktop platforms.
- The audience will vote using colored plates to determine which design most accurately matches the original mock-up.
## Prizes:
Prizes will be awarded immediately after audience voting concludes for each session.

## Participation tips:
 - There is not a lot of time. To improve your odds we recommend:
   - Be in time. This is a 10 minute challenge in a 15 minute break. You might have less time if there are delays as a sign of respect to our awesome speakers!
   - Focusing on layout first yields the best results
   - Colors do a lot too! But be prepared to choose the RGB color yourself for best results! ;)
 - The one time you are allowed to run: Use desktop, it's fastest, most likely to pass, and you can freely resize the pane.
 - Being able to interact is **not** a requirement.
 - Animations and anything asynchronous is not needed.
 - Don't leave errors for too long, this might mess up your one run and it also means the audience can't see the preview :(
